Junho Moon's GOV 1005 Final Project

https://junhomoon.shinyapps.io/world_military/

My project examines military data from different countries over time, mainly focusing on manpower, arms trade, total spending, and nuclear capabilities. 

The key feature that all of the tabs share is the user’s option to choose a timespan and select multiple countries at the same time. In addition to countries, the user can look at the data by region and also the country’s income-level. In the case of arms imports, the user can also investigate into non-state buyers, such as rebel groups or international organizations. The graphs that illustrate over-time change in weaponry, both conventional and nuclear, features area graphs, which allows the user to compare between the types of weapons and countries in a more visually intuitive manner.
